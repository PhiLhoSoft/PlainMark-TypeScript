# PlainMark - TypeScript

Rewriting my PlainMark library in TypeScript, both because it is useful (was designed to put small formatted comments in on-line apps), and to train myself to TypeScript.

Base of repository created with advices from https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/quick/nodejs.html and https://blog.risingstack.com/building-a-node-js-app-with-typescript-tutorial/ and https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter
